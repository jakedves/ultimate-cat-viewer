# Behind The Scenes of SwiftUI

I gave a talk at IBM called **"Unveiling the Magic of Apple's Latest UI Framework: Behind the Scenes of SwiftUI"**, and this repository stores the code used in the demo app we build (in under 10 minutes).

## The Ultimate Cat Viewer

The app is only written with about ~21 lines of code, but is cross-platform, responsive, works in light and dark mode, and has some built in accessibility features, such as scaling text with user's preferences.

That is the magic of SwiftUI.
